VThis is a great hotel. Awesome location in the middle of downtown, right next to the Congress Bridge that has an amazing colony of Mexican free tail bats. It's just a short walk away from many park areas, shopping districts, and historical places. The staff are super friendly, rooms are clean and have mini fridges and microwaves. I highly recommend staying here.

VGreat hotel, comfortable sleep number bed! Good customer service, because there is construction going on they are very amenable and offering free complimentary breakfast, we appreciate the gesture but so far haven't even heard the construction once. The pool patio is very nice and love the salt water pool. Great looking fitness center and all around nice, modern feel. Would definitely recommend!

VWe booked a single night for our Anniversary and we had a great experience. Check in was smooth and fast and we got straight up to our room which had been upgraded to a suite! The room was clean, modern, and had a great view of the river. Our only regret was not being able to stay longer. We ate at the restaurant for dinner which was a better experience than expected. Though the menu had fewer options and less 'fancy' food than we thought it would have, it was really good, especially the smores desert. Our waiter was attentive and kind. The pool was unique to us as it didn't appear to have chlorine in it but rather one of those natural salt type pools. It was clean and warm and I wish I could've spent more time in it. All and all, we enjoyed our time and would absolutely go back.

VWhen we arrived we were pleasantly surprised to be offered a free upgrade to a suite after telling them we were in town for our honeymoon. However, when we got to our "upgraded" room we discovered by upgrading they took away our river view. Also it was on a floor that was being renovated so there was plywood on the floor and construction material everywhere. Not much of an upgrade! We called the front desk and they moved us to another room which was also a suite but had a river view. Arriving at the new room we discovered we could only see out of one window of the room because the other window was blocked by the adjacent building. Nonetheless we had a small piece of the view we wanted and it was after midnight so we relented and went to bed. The room itself was nice and the bed was comfortable. For the price we paid I think we'll definitely choose another hotel next time we visit Austin.

VWe stayed at the Omni for one night on a Sunday into Monday. Good location downtown. We opted for the romance package with $100 dining credit, offered at a special rate. The room was a spacious corner unit with bright and sunny views to the east. The bed was very comfortable. Our television appeared to have a slight image issue with persistant static. As to the romance package, it had promised a bottle of sparkling would be in the room upon arrival, and I was told that we would be contacted prior to arrival to coordinate any special requests - neither of which happened. We did receive the wine and some chocolates eventually after I raised the issue. Overall, the stay was good, but not perfect.

VThe hotel has a great location, just off the hippest street downtown. Parking is convenient and easy. We were there for the Sunday Jazz Brunch at Geraldines. The food was outrageous! Delicious and well-prepared. The music wasn't overpowering and added to the ambience of the restaurant.

The menu is changing and has farm to table options.   Wine selection was great as well. \u000a\u000aAt the pool bar, there was a chill vibe. Good drinks and the bartender was super friendly. \u000a\u000aWould recommend you all to check it out!

Beautifully decorated hotel, fantastic location, super friendly and accommodating staff and a wonderful room to top it all off. Never had such a positive experience with a hotel in my life. A place you must stay at least once if you ever find yourself in Austin!

VGreat hotel! Clean, upscale, very nicely done hotel with larger than average rooms that are very comfortable. Couch, multiple chairs, and floor to ceiling windows. The staff was very friendly and polite. The room didn't have a coffee maker when I arrived and when I asked they brought one up in minutes (they remove and clean them after each visit and keep them stored unless you request one - which is a good thing). Coffee bar downstairs and real bar upstairs by the rooftop pool and fireplace. Easy walk to the convention center (can't get too much closer). Complimentary water or beer while you check in. They even have a few bikes you can borrow.

Everyone is so nice, they always make the stay so much more pleasant, especially when your stay is the week when it rains the whole time and it's overcast. Every Kimpton hotel is fun, for me, I always appreciate the decor and appearances and this is no different. Definitely a great stay.

VWe attended South By San Jose to see the band Temples this year, and we really loved the environment and the music! I would definitely come back to their events, the venue was clean and accessible but also had a lot of interesting charm to it. Falling right into keeping Austin weird while retaining professionalism, sign me up. We also didn't have to wait for an extraordinarily long time, which is so refreshing for SXSW.

p939
aVHotel San Jose is an epitome of charm. Little oasis of a hotel amongst the South Congress neighbourhood. Rooms were impeccable, modern and minimal. Pool area is great too  
p940

aVThis place is like yoga for my soul. Quiet & intense, hip & unpretentious, the staff is professional & thoughtful, my favorite place to stay in Austin
p942
aVHotel San Jose is local Hotelier Liz Lambert at her absolute best. This dog friendly hotel is located a few blocks from downtown and Lady Bird Johnson Lake. Best michelada in town!
p943
aVBook a stay at this bungalow-style hotel on South Congress offering everything from affordable rooms with shared baths to 425-square-foot courtyard suites. The aesthetic is warm and organic.
p944
aVwonderful hotel in an excellent location. lots of things to see, hear, and eat within a stone's throw. really sweet staff too.
p945
aVwhat a beautiful little boutique hotel. charmingly decorated, fantastic bath products, cute swimming hole, and a great coffee shop (stumptown beans) right outside!
p946
aVBest damn soap, shampoo and conditioner in any hotel in America. Really. It makes a difference. Worth staying just for the soap!
p947
aVGreat vibe. Smart modern rooms with great design. The patio lounge is a must. Sit by the pool.
p948
aVA simple but beautifully curated experience at the Hotel San Jose. Very Austin. Morning coffee from Stumptown is the best ever.
p949
aVThis is my favorite place to get a drink outside in all of Austin. Awesome vibe. The only negative is the price, but it is so worth it.
p950
aVCheck out the long walkway with flowers (on the left side of the property if you are out front facing in). And must have a michelada!  Delicious!
p951
aVFun boutique hotel. You may hear music going on late at night at this side of town, but other than that, a great place to stay
p952
aVFelt my blood pressure drop just walking to the poolside bar.  This place is so damn zen, what could you be worried about?  The maverick- beer with ginger and lemonade- is wonderful.
p953

p957
aVThe hotel offers lots of vintage rentals like typewriters, bicycles, and Polaroid cameras. Check them out to escape from twenty-first century life.
p958
aVThe patio is the best outdoor seating in Austin, which is why it\u2019s on our list of The Tastes That Make the City: Austin.
p959
aVBeautiful patio that's always lively, but not so busy that it's a problem getting a table. Order a michelada
p960

p961

p964
aVGreat place for a beer or wine on the patio. That's essentially all they serve. Beautiful simplicity. Http://ckstenberg.com

VMy wife, baby, and I stayed in one of their suites for one night and had a great experience. Every time we asked for those famous chocolate chip cookies, they gave one to us and they were always warm and soft. \u000a\u000aThey gave us a crib for our baby.\u000a\u000aThe bar downstairs let us take our drinks to our room.\u000a\u000aThe suite had a living room and a small kitchen and a great view of the city.\u000a\u000aIt's very close to the Texas State Capital.\u000a\u000aThey have an outdoor pool and a decent gym.\u000a\u000aWe'd stay here again!

VIf anyone is looking for a great deal on hotels you can check it out on HotelRaven.   com Booked a room on there and they have the cheapest rates around...\u000a\u000aI was in Austin for a convention downtown. Hyatt Place was an ideal place to stay, within walking distance of restaurants, Royal Blue Grocery and the Convention Center. It's convenient that breakfast is included, and the breakfast options were good. The staff was friendly and professional. Be prepared for costly parking (valet only, $35 day).

VI was there for an event yesterday. I parked right outside this door. Please understand, the other side of that door is the Four Seasons Hotel. There is no signage in the garage that indicates that it is not associated with the hotel. After getting a validation card for parking, the hotel staff informed me that they do not own that particular garage and therefore cannot validate the parking. (Right inside of those doors is the elevator for the Four Seasons.) To make matters worse, all the staff claimed they could do was contact the garage owner and "hope for the best." Obtuse customer service.

VBeautiful small hotel. A friend was staying there on the weekend and suggested I check it out . They said the lounge and lawn was a great hangout and the happy hour was the best . Strolling SoCo a couple of friends and I decided to check it out . We were quickly informed that we were not welcome the bar was private and for guests and members only. We explained we were told happy hour was open but we would go elsewhere just as we left it started to rain  .. We had to leave and walk back in the rain so hospitality was not what we received from the snobby staff . We were however welcomed with full hospitality at the Hotel  San Jose ...it was very nice and beautiful as well so check them out instead!

VI travel frequently for work and this is my new "go-to" hotel. It is very clean, the staff is extremely friendly and I feel safe. As a female traveling alone, the safety of a hotel is a large consideration. I've eaten a few times in the restaurant/lounge area and Courtney was a delight.

VRooms are large and trendy. Hotel has a lively bar in youthful hip area.  No coffee in rooms but complimentary in lobby and a coffee shop is nearby.  Lots of shopping and local eateries nearby to accommodate all foodies tastes. Room rates are higher than bigger hotels downtown but they can getaway with it, area so cute.

VIf anyone is looking for a great deal on hotels you can check it out on HotelRaven.   com Booked a room on there and they have the cheapest rates around...\u000a\u000aThe bar at the South Congress hotel is very stylish with dim lighting and minimalist, modern art on the walls. Most of the seating is comfortable, but some the leather butterfly chairs swallow you whole. Prices are in line with bars of this caliber: $12-15 per cocktail, $10-15 per glass of wine. While nice, I wouldn't go out of my way to return to bar here. The aesthetic is a bit too familiar to seek out when it's so prevalent in Austin.

VHotel Indigo is a pretty typical hotel with few bells and whistles. There is a heated pool which is nice. The room was fairly small and there was no mini fridge. The water pressure in the shower was weak but not terrible. The staff were extremely nice and professional. The location is obviously the best aspect of this hotel, being centrally located by the Red River music venues and 6th Street bars. Most of downtown Austin is within walking distance, and there is a Bike Share located right next to the hotel.

VWe stayed here for South by Southwest and to celebrate my husband's birthday. The location is IDEAL for SXSW and everything is walking distance from the hotel. It is clean and modern. Most importantly the staff went above and beyond to make my husband's birthday weekend special with a complimentary bottle of wine and helping me pull off a funny surprise! Highly recommend and when we visit Austin again Hotel Indigo is where we will be staying.

VGreat hotel for a girls weekend. Room spacious enough for 4 of us without being on top of each other at every turn. Hotel located steps from Nordstroms and many other wonderful shops and restaurants. Quiet, well-appointed, clean, fabulous bathrooms and amenities, comfortable bedding which is what I always look for in a hotel and Archer Austin provides all this and more. Would definitely recommend and will definitely return.

VThe stay at the W Austin isn't too bad. It has a good location and is a walk away from downtown. The check in area did feel a bit crowded for me. The room is decently sized and the layout is not bad. The desk and the nightstands in the room however should have more easily accessible power outlets. I had to stand far away from the desk and to finally notice receptacles under the desk. Service was prompt and responsive. The noise outside was a bit loud around midnight and could have better noise isolation. Overall a good stay.

VSuper swanky hotel, and super polite and friendly staff. It was a little on style over substance (cool decorations but no extra pillows or iron/ironing board). This place is too cool for me to come back but I really did enjoy the stay.\u000a\u000aEDIT: I have changed this from a 4 star review to a 5 star review due to excellent customer service. We left some expensive clothing in the room and the staff took great care of us. Very quick response time on their part, and a very low effort on my part. Thanks!!

VThis stylish, upscale, amenity-packed off-Congress hotel substitutes the long-time go-to expansive "in your face" lobbies and bars for a more twisty-turny experience that piques curiosity and makes you want to explore. In short, W Austin trades in showmanship for endless pleasant surprises. The spa, by the way, is stellar. As well, the pool area is seriously underused. Enjoy it; you'll probably have a good deal of privacy. Trace is wonderful although some menu changes disappointed me. All in all, W Austin is a wonder.

Many amenities including face wipes, curling iron, flat iron, huge flat screen built in, large comfy king with option to have a foam pillow delivered, modern decor and artwork, Starbucks Coffee and 2 waters in room with mini fridge. Great food menu choices. I'll be here again when I come back. Daniel at the front desk was very kind and helpful. Every person I've spoken to.

VHotel is very nice and the service is great. There's only a few minor issues. First, the cost of parking is just ridiculous. If you're flying in and not renting a car, no issues, but if you have a car with you prepare to part with a significant chunk of change. Second, the on-site dining options leave a lot to be desired. There's two restaurants, but one is only open for breakfast and lunch, while the other is only open for dinner. Worse, the one open for dinner serves sushi and... sushi. Even if you don't mind sushi, you surely don't want it every night, so you're pretty much forced to leave, which then of course increases the parking charges.

VIt is a bit pricey (especially if you are parking), but the service is simply awesome. Jeff is great - really went out of his way to help us. The rooms are really nice. Huge TVs for a hotel. Location is very central. Not a lot within a quick walk (like right next door), but plenty just across the bridge or just south on Congress. Hot showers, cold AC, and good selection of pillows. But we will be back because of the service.\u000a\u000aUpdate: A sickness resulted in a midnight linen change. The staff again was awesome and understanding. Service, service, service.

VMet a hotel guest for dinner at the Austin Taco Project. It was a clean modern dining space. The tacos were very good, but slightly pricey. Other than the eatery, I only saw part of the lobby. It appeared very upscale with lots of amenities. The guest I met for dinner said their room was very nice with a beautiful view of the Austin skyline.

VThe hotel itself was absolutely beautiful in the lobby. We loved the digital photos on the wall right when you walk in. The seating areas were very clean and comfortable and the staff were super friendly and helpful. We used the family restroom and it was clean and very open, however I found it odd there was no changing table in a family restroom. We ate at Cannon & Belle, the lobby bar and restaurant. Due to the high ceilings, it is quite loud and echoed. We were not very happy with the food nor the service (though the team was extremely friendly). Steps of service leave much to be desired and the food was good, but not for the price. Location was very accessible and valet was only $10 which is extremely reasonable especially when parking is not readily available. Again, the staff across the board were super friendly and personable!

VAbsolutely loved this hotel!  Stayed with a few of my friends to celebrate my 21st and they have such an amazing staff, very friendly and I was even given 3 complementary drinks at the bar for my birthday. The location is perfect and the only reason I gave it 4 stars was because when calling to request extra towels/shampoos both times it took about an hour to get to my room. Other than that a great hotel!

VFront desk staff was extremely professional and caring. Hotel is located in a convenient spot for most activities. The room was modern, clean, well kept and polished. Great view of downtown Austin. Amenities are quite good. We rewired a crib and a microwave which were immediately provided. Parking is convenient but not ideal as it seems to take forever to get from the basement parking slot to the lobby. Overall, this is a great hotel and was a wonderful stay.

VModern, high class hotel located just between the Convention center & 6th street. The conference facilities are well up to standards expected from a brand like Hilton.
p2683
aVNice hotel and it is near a lot of food/action. However, if you want quiet, beware as the noise from 6th street reaches all the way up to the 22nd floor.
p2684
aVBest dog friendly hotel in Austin! 2 Dogs up to 75lbs per room allowed. Situated right next to a dog friendly park. Bell staff have treats. Kitchen has dog bowls. Excellent all around.
p2685
aVOne of the best downtown Hiltons in the world. Recently refurbished, good facilities, friendly Staff, easy access to downtown Austin and always buzzing.
p2686
aVStandard type hotel. Rooms are clean and the location is great. Tip: the water bottles are under the table in the front vestibule. I was dying of thirst until I found them on my way out.

p2688

p2690
aVI always order in advance so table and meal is ready! Matthew Gutierrez and chef Paul are very congenial
p2691
aVGreat location if you are attending a convention. Or if you are trying to amass Hilton points. But there are more centrally located hotels with more character in Austin.
p2692
aVNice hotel. Nice staff. Wifi was really slow but I imagine it's just the result of an entire hotel filled w/an unusually high concentration of people up/downloading high bandwidth tech & music files.
p2693
aVCentrally located in downtown and easily walkable to lots of restaurants and businesses. Friendly staff and clean rooms. Ups is located inside.

VI've stayed here multiple times, and it has been a good experience. It's a charming, unique hotel and a historic building. The staff are very helpful and accomodating. It's conveniently located in downtown, and only a short walk to the convention center. My only complaint is petty: there's an air freshener or something right by the entrance that blasts an overly strong scent. But otherwise, the rooms are nice and clean, and I will happily stay here again given the chance.

VAttended a working session at the hotel. The staff was friendly, professional, and accomodating. The hotel itself has an antique feel with elaborate decorations. Despite some work being done to the outside of the building I was able to still get in and out fairly easily. The bar/lounge area was spacious but got a bit loud as happy hour began.

VBeautiful hotel. Room was somewhat small, but they always are in these older hotels. Very comfortable bed and a larger TV than we have at home. Bathroom was likewise small, but had anything we might have needed right where we I would need it. View left something to be desired (side of a building), but proximity to the state capitol and 6th Street more than makes up for it. Bar was very nice with a good variety of mixed drinks, good beer, and wine. Staff were all very helpful and courteous. Would definitely consider staying here again next time we're in Austin.

VSuch a charming old hotel!
p3167
aVThe Driskill is a historic classic boutique hotel of Austin. Lots of variations in the rooms but the Brazos suite was perfect. The large balcony overlooking 6th street and the live music made the stay
p3168
aVgreat hotel for a visit in Austin.  If not staying here still a must see for its beauty and history.  Grab a great cocktail in the bar while here.
p3169
aVThis is the spot where you want to come and enjoy a great classic hotel.  The bar is phenomenal and a great place to start early and end late!  My top spot to stay when in Austin!
p3170
aVRequest room 535 if its available or any of the corner rooms facing 6th street. You won't regret it. Then, look out for the friendly ghost! :)
p3171
aVThe 7 course wine pairing was awesome! Celebrated a belated anniversary and made us feel at home. Meal was exquisite and wine took it home. If you're in the area, this is a must!
p3172
aVTin ceilings. Cast iron statues. Crossed pistols. Glass done ceilings. And when you get to the bar, Rachel, I recommend a bourbon and elder flower liquor. It's sweet, but delicious!
p3173
aVThey say it's haunted. I say it's super classy. Totally recommended. The only 'but' is that they don't have a swimming pool, which in Texas summer should be almost mandatory.
p3174
aVPerfect for wedding receptions, company parties, or just brunch on a Sunday morning. The best thing about this place? Word has it that Room 429 (amongst others) is haunted!
p3175
aVTexas Sized Hospitality. Sets the standard for elegance & offers a restaurant, bakery, piano bar and GHOSTS. Budget travelers, this is NOT your scene. But sometimes you just gotta go for it!
p3176
aVBuilt in 1886 as the showplace of a cattle baron, the hotel stands as a landmark of Texas hospitality. The luxury hotel is close to the Capitol, Convention Center and entertainment districts.
p3177
aVThe Driskell Bar makes me swoon (when it's not SXSW mobbed). Great live music. Revolver light fixtures. Killer bartenders. (And don't miss the cupcakes sneakily for sale at the bar)
p3178
aVThis is the granddaddy of luxury hotels in Austin. Located right at Sixth Street and Congress Avenue, the Driskill has been showing off the best side of Austin since 1886.
p3179
aVWonderful staff, gorgeous building and the rooms are absolutely stunning. Within walking distance of our favorite places on 6th street.
p3180
aVFavorite spot for late night drinks. The buffet brunch is insanely popular. There is a great taxi pull up area on the side entrance.
p3181
aVThe food here is awesome.  Order a delicious cappuccino and a cranberry orange scone in the cafe if you're on a budget and enjoy the atmosphere.
p3182
aVThey say this lovely Texas landmark is haunted. Me? I don\u2019t believe in ghosts, and I had a lengthy debate about this very topic with a rather opaque visitor one autumn night in room 319.
p3183
aVThis historic hotel happens to be one of the few hotels in Austin that offers free Wi-Fi in both the rooms and the lobby \u2013 now that's what we're talking about!
p3184
aVpro tip: if you need to store jackets/laptops for a few hours or so, ask the concierge outside. there's a storage area in back. be nice and tip well!
p3185
aVplush and well furnished rooms.  lift to the rooms opens in the middle of the lobby bar.  great ambiance with live music
p3186
aVOpened in 1886, this is the oldest operating hotel in Austin. Legend has it the original owner, cattle baron Jesse Driskill, lost the hotel to his brother in law in a poker game in 1888.
p3187
aVBeautiful lobby but rooms falling apart. Nicks and scratches and just feels old. No water glasses provided in room. Took three calls to get a Housekeeping request.
p3188
aVBeautiful lobby/atrium. Solid food in the lobby cafe. Take a walk around the lobby and such to see the beauty.
p3189
aVBeautiful historical hotel with an interesting history. Had lunch here and the service left something to be desired but the food was great.
p3190
aVA true historic gem, right in the middle of downtown Austin. Be sure to inspect the statues and artwork closely.
p3191
aVHistorical luxury at its best! Beautiful lobby and common areas, and great rooms with very attentive staff. #BestOfTexas
p3192
aVWe choose it for our engagement! Loved it! Only thing I want complain about; I asked them for a upgrade but we didn't get one
p3193
aVBar is lovely upstairs. "Sage Advice" cocktail perfect. Love all the memorabilia about POTUS and FLOTUS Johnson.
p3194
aVThe lobby is absolutely majestic. Very well-preserved and maintained hotel. If you can, staying here is a must.
p3195
aVHere's a tip for the Driskill. Serve some decent top shelf in the venue. This JimBeam only crap only degrades your once impeccable name. If it is sponsorship then tell SXSW to kissyourass!
p3196
aVthe baked huevos rancheros & hangover burger are amazing at brunch.
p3197
aVUpstairs Balcony is believed to be haunted as well as room 308. Also they have Chimay on tap!
p3198
aVBeautiful classic hotel with a great cafe restaurant In it
p3199

p3201
aVGreat place to host an event. Very historic looking and is of course and the staff is great.
p3202
aVCozy and classy, but probably best to avoid on a weekend night if you want to get s spot to sit.
p3203
aVInteresting activity in the ballroom...swaying crystals in the chandelier and some flickering electricity. Had a friend feel a close brush or scrape by her shoulder...
p3204
aVEat at the 1886 Cafe and bakery for breakfast. Try the Brazos Huevos Rancheros - It's amazing.
p3205
aVMy only complaint is not experiencing a haunting...other than that..first class cattle baron style
p3206
aVLike the hotel but should be warned about the view when booking, something like "Hey dummy be happy to get some sunlight."
p3207
aVBeautiful building, attentive staff and kick ass bar. Didn't see any ghosts but enjoyed every minute of my stay so far.
p3208
aVBuilt in 1876 by a cattle baron and has hosted a history of political parties and inaugurations.In the 1970s this hotel was a hangout for musician, humorist, and journalist Richard "Kinky" Friedman.
p3209
aVThe bakery has a great brunch, and the bread pudding French toast is amazing!
p3210
aV"Opened in 1886, this is the oldest operating hotel in Austin. Legend has it the original owner, cattle baron Jesse Driskill, lost the hotel to his brother in law in a poker game in 1888."
p3211

p3212
aVBeautiful hotel!! Absolutely stunning and in central downtown Austin, smells like a dream and the bathrooms are photo shoot ready!
p3213
aVDon't count on the Foursquare check-in special about a pineapple-jalapeño soda. They've been out of ingredients for it.
p3214
aVBest secret Austin spot for live music. A-list musical talent, but cool conversational atmosphere.
p3215
aVDon\u2019t be fooled by the ostentatious surrounds\u2014this place is soulful (literally; some say it\u2019s haunted).

VI'm all about the complimentary breakfasts at hotels. It's my favorite part of staying at a hotel! Mainly because I love eating eggs. However, when I think breakfast, my mind thinks: scrambled eggs or over easy. La Quinta had hard. Boiled. Eggs. And I mean these eggs were HARD boiled. The yolk was so tough to eat. Also, their bathrooms don't have locks on them. You just push and it opens.

VHad a really nice stay here. I was actually on a business trip so I was out the most of the time. The breakfast was very good, as it was also my first time in the USA.\u000aI don't know if it was cheap or not but for a 2 bed room I would consider it reasonably priced.\u000aHad some minor problems with my cards losing their access to my room, maybe they were a bit old or so, but i wasn't too bad.

VStayed here for a business trip. This hotel is in an unsavory neighborhood. I was walking back to the hotel from the downtown area and had to step over a passed-out homeless person. A lot of riff-raff around the area. Also, some of the lights and outlets did not work. The room was REALLY clean, though. And the staff was nice.

VVery nice room, great customer service and great selection of amenities in the room. Pet friendly, but would have been nice to know that the pet cost is $100/night before I made my reservation through hotwire. Also, valet parking is $40/night. Very nice room and experience over all. Also, having toothpaste available in the room would be a nice added amenity.

VI've stayed at this hotel several times and the rooms are always cleaned and have all the amenities (plus nice little touches like a comb). It's within walking distance of anywhere downtown. Parking is very steep at $41/day and so factor that into your cost if you are driving or have a rental. This trip I was unable to reach the front desk from my phone when I wanted to check out, despite calling multiple times, so that was a little disappointing. The service is usually fine, though.

p3742
aVIn the heart of the downtown entertainment district, the Stephen F. Austin offers a old-style luxury stay. The Roaring Fork restaurant and Stephen F\u2019s Bar & Terrace within the hotel are worth a visit.

VBreakfast is great - made to order eggs/omelettes; fresh fruit; egg scramble dishes; grits/oatmeal and great views if the city.
p3813
aVThe breakfast at the hotel is totally worth it. Buffet style and the lady makes some of the best omelets I've ever had. The hotel is in a prime location.
p3814
aVSuperior hotel!! Worth every dime! Friendly front desk and valet staff. A block's walk from 6th street nightlife and everything you'd expect from a Hilton!
p3815
aVTook only 5 min to get our car from valet. Worth the $ to know my car is safe. the beds are AWESOME. They are sleep # beds basically. If you don't like it adjust it until you do. Best nights sleep!
p3816
aVGreat location. Walking distance to 6th Street and many downtown eateries. Loved being next to visitor center as well-did segway tour - fun!
p3817
aVAnother reason to stay at this Hilton Garden Inn: AT&T Wi-Fi is one of the many great amenities for guests. Look for the Stay Connected program. It\u2019s free, fast and easy to connect.
p3818
aVSuper service from guest check-in service rep to the bartender at the 18th floor restaurant. Highly recommend for travelers to Austin.
p3819
aVYou don't need a car if you're downtown! Get off your ass and Walk! $1.00 bus ride from airport, hotel is close to all the bars. Fantastic staff!
p3820
aVExcellent staff. The front lobby was never congested with check ins the whole time I was there for SXSWi 2016. Impressive.
p3821
aVBook with the Hot Summer Fun in Austin Promo ! Includes cook to order buffet and free valet! Great deal!!!
p3822
aVGreat location, friendly staff, good breakfast, nice (but small) pool.
p3823
aVThe restaurant view from the 18th floor is spectacular.  Great place to have dinner in the evening time overlooking the downtown.
p3824
aVWifi is free and close to 6th St bars, and that is where my compliments stop. Staff are not that nice, the view over the highway is horrible, awkward room layout, stagnant river walk.
p3825
aVTry the old fashioned in the 18th floor bar. Makes the view even better.
p3826
aVBreakfast buffet ends at 10AM on weekdays, 11AM on weekends.
p3827
aVGreat location. Friendly & helpful staff. Tired hotel rooms.
p3828
aV$2 parking if you visit the restaurant and bar on the 18th floor.
p3829
aVGreat view of downtown from the top floor.
p3830
aVMost overpriced parking I've experienced in Austin so far. $26/night plus tax.
p3831
aVGreat gym to use on your stay and pool and spa are great to relax at while using your laptop on the wifi
p3832
aVBeds are super uncomfortable, but great location to 6th St. Get drunk before going to bed.
p3833
aVGood location on 6th street but hotel parking is $26
p3834
aVIf you're a bit drunk, just look for that big sign to guide you home!
p3835
aVIf you have a back problem stay somewhere else. Otherwise,  great location,  close to 6th street.  Breakfast nothing to be excited about.
p3836
aVProbably the worst hotel in the entire world. So many screwed up reservations. Don't come if you want to have the room you booked and paid for.
p3837
aVFirst they charge $30 for parking. Then it takes 30 minutes to get car. Valets work hard but too few of them!
p3838

p3841

aVDon't bring your car, take taxi. It's simple and yet financially smart comparing to overpriced valet service.
p3843
aVThe wifi sucks. Don't bother with it.
p3844
aVTry the coffee
p3845

VThis hotel is within walking distance (not exceptionally close, but still not unbearably far kind of walking distance) of downtown, sixth street, etc. The rooms were spacious and had the expected essentials. Lobby was clean and comfortable. Staff was attentive and helpful. On-site parking was included, which was a nice bonus. Continental breakfast was great with a good amount of variety. Another perk was happy hour from 5-7 every night, which offered complimentary cocktails, draft beer, wine, and snacks at the bar.

VGot this hotel for one of my wedding blocks based on the central Austin location, and my guests who stayed there seemed to like it a lot!  Great hotel to stay in. HOWEVER, I planned a casual evening event (~8 pm on a Friday night) at the hotel restaurant and bar for about 50 people to mingle before the wedding day. I planned this event FAR in advance and I called (and emailed) the hotel sales manager that 50 people would be coming to the bar and restaurant all at once and I wanted to provide ample time to prepare. In writing AND verbally, she assured me that the bar/restaurant would be appropriately staffed. I\u2019ll cut to the chase - it was NOT. We walk in and the bartender starts FREAKING OUT, picking up and slamming down the phone asking for back up, yelling at customers trying to order (who were being completely calm and patient), and even SPRINTING to the kitchen and back. It was chaos and it didn\u2019t make for a very pleasant event.\u000a\u000aIt took the mother of the bride AN HOUR AND A HALF to get her food, and she was one of the first ones to order. I think that with the amount of planning done and the promise from the sales manager that they would be ready - ALSO with my guests giving them their money for the hotel rooms - that this was unacceptable. I have not been contacted by the hotel or the sales manager as of yet. \u000a\u000aLong story short - stay here, do not plan events here. Especially if you want your guests to get appropriate service.

VThe hotel itself is very nice. Newly renovated, clean, and comfortable. The neighborhood is another story. There are at least 50 homeless/mentally ill/drug addicted people milling around and sleeping on the street all the time. To get to 6th street, the convention center, etc, you have to go through them.  There's a Salvation Army a block from the hotel, which I assume is the draw, but I never saw anyone actually go inside. In addition, there is a music venue across the street with loud music and cheering that starts around 9 and goes late. Don't expect to get to sleep early if your room is on that side of the hotel.

VGreat spot. Not a lot of restaurants and bars in the immediate area, but there are some within walking distance. Also 6th Street is a couple blocks away. Had a great stay for a good price. Complimentary breakfast in the morning was also pretty good. Would definitely go back.

I'm really loving the Hampton Inn hotels lately. This was in a great location between the Capitol and the Bob Bullock Museum. Even UT was in easy walking distance.

VThe place was nice. The room was actually pretty good. However, I had issues where the card wasn't working after the first day. Then when I got home I was charged extra. I tried calling them to fix the issue and they just made some excuses and said they'll call me back. Which of course, they didn't. I'm very disappointed.

VAvoid the 3 floor. Some of the windows fully open onto a roof. I may be paranoid but people could climb out and peek/break in your room. No mini bar, towels for one. Love the layout of the king suite
p4752
aVPaul Mitchell toiletries, free good breakfast, they allow dogs ($100 fee), and great location. Every room has full-size fridge and dishwasher. We love it here.
p4753
aVUpdate: the GM and staff handled everything very professionally and have completely remedied the situation in true Marriott fashion. I would return here any time. Good job team.
p4754
aVSuper friendly staff, very clean room, great free buffet breakfast in the Champions lounge.  Would definitely stay here again!!
p4755
aVFavourite hotel.  Starbucks downstairs and not as busy or noisy as the main hotels which is good when you roll in at 3am ready to drop
p4756
aVThe back side of the hotel looks over the city, which you'd think would be great, except 6th St and the alley below are loud at night.
p4757
aVGreat staff and service! Very clean and seems new.
p4758
aVWhen using the self park, ask for a few of the gate key card. I had 4 fail on me.
p4759
aVPool is small but adjoining hot tub is cool. And balcony Off pool area allows smoking. Sweet.
p4760
aVIf you ask nicely @championsaustin will deliver to your room before 4pm, like it says on the menu.
p4761
aVSome rooms have older TVs with analog inputs only. Don't expect to hook up your iPad to the TV.
p4762
aVMinimum stay policies at @MarriottAustin for SXSW seem greedy and unnecessarily hostile toward customers. It's not like they'd have any difficulty filling this place every single night.
p4763
aVI can only assume This hotel has an issue with thefts because guards stand outside after 10pm to verify you have a room at the hotel. Also, everyone is rude rude rude. Pets do not stay free- $100
p4764
aVAsk for Kylie! She'll hook you up.
p4765
aVAll newly done rooms. Nice!
p4766
aVRemember to flip the switch in your freezer, or else your fridge won't make ice.

VOld hotel but revamped right on the Colorado River and a short 10mins walk to Downtown Austin and 5mins from the famous Bat Bridge with great views. Staff was knowledgeable and helpful  
p4791
aVI was particularly impressed with the fitness center.  The room has a nice selection of treadmills, free weights and other exercise equipment.
p4792
aVPriority Club Level on floor 11, got a spacious room, lake view and brand new tv and bed, though the style is still outdated... Anyway free water, free wifi... I like
p4793
aVWhether you're here for a layover or a business trip, do yourself a favor and become a temporary alcoholic by hitting up Rainey St. Houses disguised as bars eliminate a dull pub crawl?  Yes, please.
p4794
aVDated and cramped rooms.  Elevator situation poor for the number of guests.  The nice part is the central location right on the running/walking trail.
p4795
aVSituated on the eastern edge of downtown and on the lake gives guests a spectacular view from just about any room.
p4796
aVThe roach coach's next door have good food. A little pricey but more than enough grub for a serving size
p4797
aVUpdated rooms now. Nice tv's and beds. Kind of far from downtown, but convenient to I-35. Good view in lake view rooms.
p4798
aVA little bit of a walk from downtown (okay a long walk) but cheap and clean enough. Pool on the top of the garage (6th floor)
p4799
aVThe service in the restaurant is like amazing. Not excpected but superb.
p4800
aVIt's considered a fire hazard to bring a cot into a room that already has two beds. If you have three people sharing one room, claim a bed quickly. The floor is uncomfortable.
p4801
aVNice to have shuttle service from the airport and I even got a ride downtown, too.
p4802
aVYou can race around the circular hallway on your floor. Fastest lap: 5.73 seconds (w/ socks)
p4803
aVSkip the Hotel Breakfast, go get some breakfast tacos from the food trucks across the parking lot.
p4804
aVIf you get the handicap room and are taller than 5'5" hang the shower head over the shower curtain rod so you don't have to squat.  But don't expect water pressure or hot water.
p4805
aVFree wi-fi and late checkout early checkin. Friendly staff; bit of a walk to con cntr
p4806
aVLook for the price its a deal. Free aiport shuttle is clutch
p4807

p4808
aVEverything sets into place.. free wifi
p4809
aVThey do awesome Segway tours. Well worth it.
p4810
aVIts been said, but needs to be said again. Incredibly dated rooms. 2.5 star hotel
p4811
aVThe room sucks and the shower had hair in it. This hotel is dirty and the water smells disgusting. It's too far from downtown. I really don't have anything good to say about this hotel.
p4812
aVDon't drink the water; it smells like the lake.
p4813
aVCoin dryer in the workout room doesn't dry your clothes.
p4814
aVFree business center and very helpful staff!
p4815

p4817
aVAirport shuttle stops at 10 pm
p4818

VI'm all about the complimentary breakfasts at hotels. It's my favorite part of staying at a hotel! Mainly because I love eating eggs. However, when I think breakfast, my mind thinks: scrambled eggs or over easy. La Quinta had hard. Boiled. Eggs. And I mean these eggs were HARD boiled. The yolk was so tough to eat. Also, their bathrooms don't have locks on them. You just push and it opens.

VHad a really nice stay here. I was actually on a business trip so I was out the most of the time. The breakfast was very good, as it was also my first time in the USA.\u000aI don't know if it was cheap or not but for a 2 bed room I would consider it reasonably priced.\u000aHad some minor problems with my cards losing their access to my room, maybe they were a bit old or so, but i wasn't too bad.

VStayed here for a business trip. This hotel is in an unsavory neighborhood. I was walking back to the hotel from the downtown area and had to step over a passed-out homeless person. A lot of riff-raff around the area. Also, some of the lights and outlets did not work. The room was REALLY clean, though. And the staff was nice.
