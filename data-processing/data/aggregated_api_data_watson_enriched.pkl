VThis is a great hotel. Awesome location in the middle of downtown, right next to the Congress Bridge that has an amazing colony of Mexican free tail bats. It's just a short walk away from many park areas, shopping districts, and historical places. The staff are super friendly, rooms are clean and have mini fridges and microwaves. I highly recommend staying here.

VGreat hotel, comfortable sleep number bed! Good customer service, because there is construction going on they are very amenable and offering free complimentary breakfast, we appreciate the gesture but so far haven't even heard the construction once. The pool patio is very nice and love the salt water pool. Great looking fitness center and all around nice, modern feel. Would definitely recommend!

VWe booked a single night for our Anniversary and we had a great experience. Check in was smooth and fast and we got straight up to our room which had been upgraded to a suite! The room was clean, modern, and had a great view of the river. Our only regret was not being able to stay longer. We ate at the restaurant for dinner which was a better experience than expected. Though the menu had fewer options and less 'fancy' food than we thought it would have, it was really good, especially the smores desert. Our waiter was attentive and kind. The pool was unique to us as it didn't appear to have chlorine in it but rather one of those natural salt type pools. It was clean and warm and I wish I could've spent more time in it. All and all, we enjoyed our time and would absolutely go back.

VWhen we arrived we were pleasantly surprised to be offered a free upgrade to a suite after telling them we were in town for our honeymoon. However, when we got to our "upgraded" room we discovered by upgrading they took away our river view. Also it was on a floor that was being renovated so there was plywood on the floor and construction material everywhere. Not much of an upgrade! We called the front desk and they moved us to another room which was also a suite but had a river view. Arriving at the new room we discovered we could only see out of one window of the room because the other window was blocked by the adjacent building. Nonetheless we had a small piece of the view we wanted and it was after midnight so we relented and went to bed. The room itself was nice and the bed was comfortable. For the price we paid I think we'll definitely choose another hotel next time we visit Austin.

The bed was comfortable, I could hear very little noise from the hallway  and none from the room above me. The shower had good water pressure and the bathroom was spacious. Jose the concierge went out of his way to help. I would definitely stay here again.

VWe stayed at the Omni for one night on a Sunday into Monday. Good location downtown. We opted for the romance package with $100 dining credit, offered at a special rate. The room was a spacious corner unit with bright and sunny views to the east. The bed was very comfortable. Our television appeared to have a slight image issue with persistant static. As to the romance package, it had promised a bottle of sparkling would be in the room upon arrival, and I was told that we would be contacted prior to arrival to coordinate any special requests - neither of which happened. We did receive the wine and some chocolates eventually after I raised the issue. Overall, the stay was good, but not perfect.

Everyone is so nice, they always make the stay so much more pleasant, especially when your stay is the week when it rains the whole time and it's overcast. Every Kimpton hotel is fun, for me, I always appreciate the decor and appearances and this is no different. Definitely a great stay.

VGreat hotel! Clean, upscale, very nicely done hotel with larger than average rooms that are very comfortable. Couch, multiple chairs, and floor to ceiling windows. The staff was very friendly and polite. The room didn't have a coffee maker when I arrived and when I asked they brought one up in minutes (they remove and clean them after each visit and keep them stored unless you request one - which is a good thing). Coffee bar downstairs and real bar upstairs by the rooftop pool and fireplace. Easy walk to the convention center (can't get too much closer). Complimentary water or beer while you check in. They even have a few bikes you can borrow.

I would definitely come back to their events, the venue was clean and accessible but also had a lot of interesting charm to it. Falling right into keeping Austin weird while retaining professionalism, sign me up. We also didn't have to wait for an extraordinarily long time, which is so refreshing for SXSW.

VThe pool and lawn area are immaculate. The drinks however we're a bit on the lighter side (I guess that's just about expected) but it was made up for by having a waiter while at the pool. Rooms are nice and cozy. Definitely feels nice than your average hotel all around. No real easy parking. Either valet or good luck finding street parking in downtown.

VIf anyone is looking for a great deal on hotels you can check it out on HoteIRaven.  com Booked a hotel on there and they had the cheapest rates around...\u000a\u000aThe pool and lawn area are immaculate. The drinks however we're a bit on the lighter side (I guess that's just about expected) but it was made up for by having a waiter while at the pool. Rooms are nice and cozy. Definitely feels nice than your average hotel all around. No real easy parking. Either valet or good luck finding street parking in downtown.

VWent to Trio for the Easter brunch. The selection was amazing. Everything from sushi to lamb. Service was great as always. Only thing is that I'm not sure it's worth the higher price on a holiday vs the already great brunch they offer every Sunday. Didnt seem like there were any more options than usual.

VI was there for an event yesterday. I parked right outside this door. Please understand, the other side of that door is the Four Seasons Hotel. There is no signage in the garage that indicates that it is not associated with the hotel. After getting a validation card for parking, the hotel staff informed me that they do not own that particular garage and therefore cannot validate the parking. (Right inside of those doors is the elevator for the Four Seasons.) To make matters worse, all the staff claimed they could do was contact the garage owner and "hope for the best." Obtuse customer service.

VBeautiful small hotel. A friend was staying there on the weekend and suggested I check it out . They said the lounge and lawn was a great hangout and the happy hour was the best . Strolling SoCo a couple of friends and I decided to check it out . We were quickly informed that we were not welcome the bar was private and for guests and members only. We explained we were told happy hour was open but we would go elsewhere just as we left it started to rain  .. We had to leave and walk back in the rain so hospitality was not what we received from the snobby staff . We were however welcomed with full hospitality at the Hotel  San Jose ...it was very nice and beautiful as well so check them out instead!

VRooms are large and trendy. Hotel has a lively bar in youthful hip area.  No coffee in rooms but complimentary in lobby and a coffee shop is nearby.  Lots of shopping and local eateries nearby to accommodate all foodies tastes. Room rates are higher than bigger hotels downtown but they can getaway with it, area so cute.

While nice, I wouldn't go out of my way to return to bar here. The aesthetic is a bit too familiar to seek out when it's so prevalent in Austin.

Beautiful patio area with greenery and a fountain. They also have a bar large lobby and bar area for unique cocktails and bar food. Staff is some of the friendliest people I have met. Beautiful relaxing pool on the rooftop that overlooks Congress Ave with plenty of shopping and unique restaraunts within walking distance.

VHotel Indigo is a pretty typical hotel with few bells and whistles. There is a heated pool which is nice. The room was fairly small and there was no mini fridge. The water pressure in the shower was weak but not terrible. The staff were extremely nice and professional. The location is obviously the best aspect of this hotel, being centrally located by the Red River music venues and 6th Street bars. Most of downtown Austin is within walking distance, and there is a Bike Share located right next to the hotel.

Most importantly the staff went above and beyond to make my husband's birthday weekend special with a complimentary bottle of wine and helping me pull off a funny surprise! Highly recommend and when we visit Austin again Hotel Indigo is where we will be staying.

VGreat hotel for a girls weekend. Room spacious enough for 4 of us without being on top of each other at every turn. Hotel located steps from Nordstroms and many other wonderful shops and restaurants. Quiet, well-appointed, clean, fabulous bathrooms and amenities, comfortable bedding which is what I always look for in a hotel and Archer Austin provides all this and more. Would definitely recommend and will definitely return.

VThe stay at the W Austin isn't too bad. It has a good location and is a walk away from downtown. The check in area did feel a bit crowded for me. The room is decently sized and the layout is not bad. The desk and the nightstands in the room however should have more easily accessible power outlets. I had to stand far away from the desk and to finally notice receptacles under the desk. Service was prompt and responsive. The noise outside was a bit loud around midnight and could have better noise isolation. Overall a good stay.

VSuper swanky hotel, and super polite and friendly staff. It was a little on style over substance (cool decorations but no extra pillows or iron/ironing board). This place is too cool for me to come back but I really did enjoy the stay.\u000a\u000aEDIT: I have changed this from a 4 star review to a 5 star review due to excellent customer service. We left some expensive clothing in the room and the staff took great care of us. Very quick response time on their part, and a very low effort on my part. Thanks!!

VThis stylish, upscale, amenity-packed off-Congress hotel substitutes the long-time go-to expansive "in your face" lobbies and bars for a more twisty-turny experience that piques curiosity and makes you want to explore. In short, W Austin trades in showmanship for endless pleasant surprises. The spa, by the way, is stellar. As well, the pool area is seriously underused. Enjoy it; you'll probably have a good deal of privacy. Trace is wonderful although some menu changes disappointed me. All in all, W Austin is a wonder.

VHotel is very nice and the service is great. There's only a few minor issues. First, the cost of parking is just ridiculous. If you're flying in and not renting a car, no issues, but if you have a car with you prepare to part with a significant chunk of change. Second, the on-site dining options leave a lot to be desired. There's two restaurants, but one is only open for breakfast and lunch, while the other is only open for dinner. Worse, the one open for dinner serves sushi and... sushi. Even if you don't mind sushi, you surely don't want it every night, so you're pretty much forced to leave, which then of course increases the parking charges.

Location is very central. Not a lot within a quick walk (like right next door), but plenty just across the bridge or just south on Congress. Hot showers, cold AC, and good selection of pillows. But we will be back because of the service.\u000a\u000aUpdate: A sickness resulted in a midnight linen change. The staff again was awesome and understanding. Service, service, service.

VThe hotel itself was absolutely beautiful in the lobby. We loved the digital photos on the wall right when you walk in. The seating areas were very clean and comfortable and the staff were super friendly and helpful. We used the family restroom and it was clean and very open, however I found it odd there was no changing table in a family restroom. We ate at Cannon & Belle, the lobby bar and restaurant. Due to the high ceilings, it is quite loud and echoed. We were not very happy with the food nor the service (though the team was extremely friendly). Steps of service leave much to be desired and the food was good, but not for the price. Location was very accessible and valet was only $10 which is extremely reasonable especially when parking is not readily available. Again, the staff across the board were super friendly and personable!

VMet a hotel guest for dinner at the Austin Taco Project. It was a clean modern dining space. The tacos were very good, but slightly pricey. Other than the eatery, I only saw part of the lobby. It appeared very upscale with lots of amenities. The guest I met for dinner said their room was very nice with a beautiful view of the Austin skyline.

VAbsolutely loved this hotel!  Stayed with a few of my friends to celebrate my 21st and they have such an amazing staff, very friendly and I was even given 3 complementary drinks at the bar for my birthday. The location is perfect and the only reason I gave it 4 stars was because when calling to request extra towels/shampoos both times it took about an hour to get to my room. Other than that a great hotel!

VFront desk staff was extremely professional and caring. Hotel is located in a convenient spot for most activities. The room was modern, clean, well kept and polished. Great view of downtown Austin. Amenities are quite good. We rewired a crib and a microwave which were immediately provided. Parking is convenient but not ideal as it seems to take forever to get from the basement parking slot to the lobby. Overall, this is a great hotel and was a wonderful stay.

VI've stayed here multiple times, and it has been a good experience. It's a charming, unique hotel and a historic building. The staff are very helpful and accomodating. It's conveniently located in downtown, and only a short walk to the convention center. My only complaint is petty: there's an air freshener or something right by the entrance that blasts an overly strong scent. But otherwise, the rooms are nice and clean, and I will happily stay here again given the chance.

VAttended a working session at the hotel. The staff was friendly, professional, and accomodating. The hotel itself has an antique feel with elaborate decorations. Despite some work being done to the outside of the building I was able to still get in and out fairly easily. The bar/lounge area was spacious but got a bit loud as happy hour began.

VBeautiful hotel. Room was somewhat small, but they always are in these older hotels. Very comfortable bed and a larger TV than we have at home. Bathroom was likewise small, but had anything we might have needed right where we I would need it. View left something to be desired (side of a building), but proximity to the state capitol and 6th Street more than makes up for it. Bar was very nice with a good variety of mixed drinks, good beer, and wine. Staff were all very helpful and courteous. Would definitely consider staying here again next time we're in Austin.

VI've stayed at this hotel several times and the rooms are always cleaned and have all the amenities (plus nice little touches like a comb). It's within walking distance of anywhere downtown. Parking is very steep at $41/day and so factor that into your cost if you are driving or have a rental. This trip I was unable to reach the front desk from my phone when I wanted to check out, despite calling multiple times, so that was a little disappointing. The service is usually fine, though.

VI'm all about the complimentary breakfasts at hotels. It's my favorite part of staying at a hotel! Mainly because I love eating eggs. However, when I think breakfast, my mind thinks: scrambled eggs or over easy. La Quinta had hard. Boiled. Eggs. And I mean these eggs were HARD boiled. The yolk was so tough to eat. Also, their bathrooms don't have locks on them. You just push and it opens.

VHad a really nice stay here. I was actually on a business trip so I was out the most of the time. The breakfast was very good, as it was also my first time in the USA.\u000aI don't know if it was cheap or not but for a 2 bed room I would consider it reasonably priced.\u000aHad some minor problems with my cards losing their access to my room, maybe they were a bit old or so, but i wasn't too bad.

VStayed here for a business trip. This hotel is in an unsavory neighborhood. I was walking back to the hotel from the downtown area and had to step over a passed-out homeless person. A lot of riff-raff around the area. Also, some of the lights and outlets did not work. The room was REALLY clean, though. And the staff was nice.

Lobby was clean and comfortable. Staff was attentive and helpful. On-site parking was included, which was a nice bonus. Continental breakfast was great with a good amount of variety. Another perk was happy hour from 5-7 every night, which offered complimentary cocktails, draft beer, wine, and snacks at the bar.

VGot this hotel for one of my wedding blocks based on the central Austin location, and my guests who stayed there seemed to like it a lot!  Great hotel to stay in. HOWEVER, I planned a casual evening event (~8 pm on a Friday night) at the hotel restaurant and bar for about 50 people to mingle before the wedding day. I planned this event FAR in advance and I called (and emailed) the hotel sales manager that 50 people would be coming to the bar and restaurant all at once and I wanted to provide ample time to prepare. In writing AND verbally, she assured me that the bar/restaurant would be appropriately staffed. I\u2019ll cut to the chase - it was NOT. We walk in and the bartender starts FREAKING OUT, picking up and slamming down the phone asking for back up, yelling at customers trying to order (who were being completely calm and patient), and even SPRINTING to the kitchen and back. It was chaos and it didn\u2019t make for a very pleasant event.\u000a\u000aIt took the mother of the bride AN HOUR AND A HALF to get her food, and she was one of the first ones to order. I think that with the amount of planning done and the promise from the sales manager that they would be ready - ALSO with my guests giving them their money for the hotel rooms - that this was unacceptable. I have not been contacted by the hotel or the sales manager as of yet. \u000a\u000aLong story short - stay here, do not plan events here. Especially if you want your guests to get appropriate service.

VEnjoyed my stay here. The room was clean, well stocked, and comfortable. The staff was very professional and pleasant in their service. The included breakfast was good but not as good as it was in the 90s when I was a kid. I would definitely recommend staying here if you have the option.

VNothing better than a Four Seasons especially the one in Austin. The service is top notch across the hotel. The location of the hotel right downtown Austin on Town Lake is gorgeous. Very nice bar area and restaurant down stairs. A great place to relax and have fun. Don't forget to bring a gold bar to have your car parked...

VThe hotel itself is very nice. Newly renovated, clean, and comfortable. The neighborhood is another story. There are at least 50 homeless/mentally ill/drug addicted people milling around and sleeping on the street all the time. To get to 6th street, the convention center, etc, you have to go through them.  There's a Salvation Army a block from the hotel, which I assume is the draw, but I never saw anyone actually go inside. In addition, there is a music venue across the street with loud music and cheering that starts around 9 and goes late. Don't expect to get to sleep early if your room is on that side of the hotel.

I'm really loving the Hampton Inn hotels lately. This was in a great location between the Capitol and the Bob Bullock Museum. Even UT was in easy walking distance.

VEverything is fine but it generally feels understaffed. A lot of the little things are missing like water in the fitness center. Overall the rooms are large and quite nice.

VI'm all about the complimentary breakfasts at hotels. It's my favorite part of staying at a hotel! Mainly because I love eating eggs. However, when I think breakfast, my mind thinks: scrambled eggs or over easy. La Quinta had hard. Boiled. Eggs. And I mean these eggs were HARD boiled. The yolk was so tough to eat. Also, their bathrooms don't have locks on them. You just push and it opens.

VHad a really nice stay here. I was actually on a business trip so I was out the most of the time. The breakfast was very good, as it was also my first time in the USA.\u000aI don't know if it was cheap or not but for a 2 bed room I would consider it reasonably priced.\u000aHad some minor problems with my cards losing their access to my room, maybe they were a bit old or so, but i wasn't too bad.

VAmazing location right near the Capitol Building. Rooms are decent with good Internet. Valet parking cost extra but very nice people who helped with multiple trips out and back taking forever to unload kids.

VStayed here for a business trip. This hotel is in an unsavory neighborhood. I was walking back to the hotel from the downtown area and had to step over a passed-out homeless person. A lot of riff-raff around the area. Also, some of the lights and outlets did not work. The room was REALLY clean, though. And the staff was nice.
