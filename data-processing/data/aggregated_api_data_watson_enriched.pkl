In writing AND verbally, she assured me that the bar\\/restaurant would be appropriately staffed. I\\u2019ll cut to the chase - it was NOT. We walk in and the bartender starts FREAKING OUT, picking up and slamming down the phone asking for back up, yelling at customers trying to order (who were being completely calm and patient), and even SPRINTING to the kitchen and back. It was chaos and it didn\\u2019t make for a very pleasant event.\\n\\nIt took the mother of the bride AN HOUR AND A HALF to get her food, and she was one of the first ones to order.
