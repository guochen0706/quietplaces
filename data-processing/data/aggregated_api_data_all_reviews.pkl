VThe thing is I have been to truly wonderful pilates classes where the level of instruction AND service are superlative - i.e. a five star experience.  My assumption was that Austin Ballet Pilates Center offered such a service.  This is NOT the case.  Let me be crystal clear here:  You will NOT get attentive instructors.  You will get good instructors who know what they're doing.  You will also pay $30/class for them to lay there and get their work out in, paying more attention to themselves than to students who have paid an incredibly premium price for a presumably premium service.  I have NEVER been to a studio where the teachers routinely join in for the entire hour.  I have often encouraged instructors to join in but at the various studios I have frequented all over the country, they have demonstrated but always stopped after the demonstration in favor of correcting the form and thus improving the quality of their students' workouts.  \u000aThis is NOT those places.  Austin Ballet pilates instructors are NOT there to teach us.  They're there to make some money while they get their workout. \u000aI am on the cusp of changing as soon as I find a high quality studio.  I welcome suggestions.\u000a\u000aAustin Ballet, if you're reading this, DO SOMETHING.  This is a terrible reputation to have.

VDr. Matt and his staff are wonderful! They are extremely knowledgeable in the area of dentistry as they are very helpful in preventing future gum or teeth issues or treating them if it comes to that point. The location of their office is more centrally located then when they were in Westlake. Folks that use public transportation should have a much easier time getting to their office or folks that drive can get their parking validated by Dr. Matt's office folks. Parking is taken care of when parking in the garage just next to their office on San Antonio St. Excellent experience every time I go! Keep it up!!!

VShane Matt is by far the best dentist I have ever had! I have been having TMJ problems and his technique to fix it is amazing! He was able to graph and show me exactly what was going on with my bite causing this intense pain. I was helped immediately without pills or medicine. He did TENS on me and I slept like a baby throughout the night. I hadn't slept in 5 days. I am actually excited to get fitted for my orthodontic appliance that I know is going to help! In 24 hours he has done what no other dentist or Dr could fix. I am so happy to not be on steroids and muscle relaxers and get REAL advice to know what is really going on with my bite causing this.

VI haven't been able to step foot in a dentist's office after a traumatic experience about 4 years ago. It took a lot of help and support from friends, family and an awesome acupuncturist (Anne Cusick) to get me through the door. Dr. Matt and his amazing and supportive staff did the rest. They were patient and sensitive, attentive to my issues. They gave me all the time I needed. We started slow with a simple (painless and fast!) cleaning a few weeks ago that gave hope I could move beyond my fear. Today I had an old mercury filling removed and replaced with a porcelain one. I feel that with their help I turned a corner on my phobia and put my traumatic experience behind me. I highly recommend these folks. They are top-notch. And they have great taste in music too.

VShane Matt, D.D.S., at Authentic Smiles really knows his stuff:  he knows the history, and the fact from the fiction.  He set me on the right track.  He's also a great guy and supportive member of the community here in Austin; the coolest dentist since Doc Holliday, really, not to mention a far superior dentist to Doc (who, let's face it, lived in the stone age as far as dentistry was concerned).  Aside from that, the office staff are very knowledgeable and personable, and you really feel welcome and well taken care of; top notch all around.

VNot known for the best sound in town, it's still a big room with great sight lines and a decent balcony to make sure your favorite artist knows you're there.
p662
aVI rue the day they installed that balcony. If you happen to be stuck on the ground behind it, you totally miss out. Get balcony seats or show up early or you may pretty much miss out.
p663
aVExpect standing room only on the bottom floor, but you can still grab first-come, first-serve bleacher seating at the top. It\u2019s architecturally beautiful and walking distance from downtown.
p664
aVThis place usually books up at the last minute for a big act at SxSW, like Lil Wayne in 2012. Check him out on Spotify: http://spoti.fi/KoEdrG
p665
aVFor any concert: If you'll be sitting/standing on the balcony, get here early. Check out the happenings during SXSW at do512.com!

aVYou can get handy listings for shows here, and food and bars around the concert hall on taap.it during SXSW
p671
aVWow the acoustics here are really abysmal - tinny, uncoordinated, and unpleasantly jarring. Don't go here for a heavy metal/rock show!
p672
aVGet here early or buy the good seats. Getting here late sucks. The workers need to figure out where they want people to stand.
p673
aVIf you're short and on the floor you won't be able to see and you might get trampled. Bad venue.
p674
aVDrop the brightness on your smartphones. You'll annoy your neighbors less and your battery will last longer.

aVFor the best sound, head to the balcony. The acoustics everywhere else just don\u2019t compare. \u2013 Vidhisha B.
p680
aVOkay enough venue and a good place for SXSW events. Somehow a single Bud Light was 4 dollars. That's impressive.

VWhen I called Air Recovery Heating & AC , the technician first told me to try a few small things to see if it would resolve my issue before a service call (not trying to just take my money..Awesome). Called them back and Tech came out within 30 minutes on a Saturday,  was professional and not pushy and and fixed all my issues under 30 minutes! And the cost was reasonable compared to other companies.. I would highly recommend them to anyone with AC issues.

VThe classes may be ok but it so frustrating to allow 20 extra minutes before a class to try to find parking only to pay to park at city hall its not even worth it. The handful of free parking spots for ballet Austin patrons has even been reduced further and replaced with permit only parking.

VThe thing is I have been to truly wonderful pilates classes where the level of instruction AND service are superlative - i.e. a five star experience.  My assumption was that Austin Ballet Pilates Center offered such a service.  This is NOT the case.  Let me be crystal clear here:  You will NOT get attentive instructors.  You will get good instructors who know what they're doing.  You will also pay $30/class for them to lay there and get their work out in, paying more attention to themselves than to students who have paid an incredibly premium price for a presumably premium service.  I have NEVER been to a studio where the teachers routinely join in for the entire hour.  I have often encouraged instructors to join in but at the various studios I have frequented all over the country, they have demonstrated but always stopped after the demonstration in favor of correcting the form and thus improving the quality of their students' workouts.  \u000aThis is NOT those places.  Austin Ballet pilates instructors are NOT there to teach us.  They're there to make some money while they get their workout. \u000aI am on the cusp of changing as soon as I find a high quality studio.  I welcome suggestions.\u000a\u000aAustin Ballet, if you're reading this, DO SOMETHING.  This is a terrible reputation to have.

VI was very surprised with this venue -- in a good way!  I liked how it was open to the outside so you could mingle on the patio furniture while waiting for the music to start. It's intimate without being confining and has great acoustics from anywhere you stand. The bar prices are a little steep, but that is to be expected at any music venue (and for a craft beer junkie).

VExperience was great except for some of the staff was pretty rude. I was looking for water fountains and was accidentally walking towards what I guess was backstage? Staff told me to turn around if I was looking for bathrooms and I politely said I was sorry and I was looking for water. She rudely directed me around the corner, which was indeed where I was walking towards anyways. I mean damn lady I bet it feels good to have authority but I was just thirsty. About 10 minutes later, my sister and I were running to catch a show. One of the staff asked  us to stop running and before we were even given two seconds to let that register/let us slow down, another staff member said "No running means NO RUNNING" like we're in kindergarten or something. \u000a\u000aIf it wasn't for the relative politeness of the bartender and the checkpoint security personnel who made up for the rest of the staff, as well as having an otherwise great experience, my rating would be two stars instead of three.

VLOVED IT, when we went to see PETER FRAMPTON, last night went to see TESLA, after 5 security checks, while watching the concert, was racially profiled inside, by some rude asshole , who even refused to give a name or title. Gives you ill feeling, we both got sick to our stomach, and the entire staff I would have to say politely is RUDE. Each other piggy back off one another. We are so deeply disappointed, we are never going back, Staff is plain rude, even after complaining, the Staff did Nothing and we ended up leaving in 1st 30 minutes as TESLA started to Play... I have zero tolerance for racial profiling and Thankfully, this was in our control whether to stay or leave, we decided to LEAVE..............Thank you Moody Theater & Staff for ruining OUR evening..............

VThis place has an absolutely amazing collection of things that literally gave me that 'kid in a candy store' moment the second I walked in, but it's a toy store. I'm 27, but there are still dozens of things here I'm giddy about. \u000a\u000aPerfect place to get a gift for others (or if you want to treat yourself), I can't wait for my wallet to stop dreaming as I'm definitely going back :)

VWhenever my boyfriend and I visit Height & Ash bury, we always make a stop here and buy at least one box.  They've got a great selection of all their current lines and some limited editions too.  There's a lot of apparel and merchandise available for purchase as well.  I always love browsing through their custom designed figures!  They've got display cases all around their small shop filled with custom collectibles of every size and shape.  Some people are just so creative and talented.

VMy girlfriend I lived at the AMLI on 2nd for one year. We moved because I moved closer to my job. First, the location is incredible. You can walk everywhere downtown, and you have easy access to the highway so you can get out of the city fast if you need to. The apartment is great. They have an amazing pool, gym, and other amenities. The best thing that this place has is there staff. Everyone was so accommodating there. James, who is the property manager, does an excellent job from first giving you a tour of the place to every time you need to speak with him all throughout your time there. He really makes the apartment building a home. Any time we had an issue with our apartment things would get done fast. In the middle of summer we had an issue with our air conditioner on a Sunday. It was 80+ degrees and climbing in our apartment. Even though maintenance didn't have to come and fix it because it was Sunday, they did anyway. If you are looking for a place to live downtown, don't overlook the AMLI on 2nd. James and his staff really make it incredible to live there.

VFloor plans are wrong on the website and this is not clarified in tours. \u000a\u000aMe and my wife were interested in the Holly Floor Plan which has a window on 2 perpendicular sides of the living room and a patio which goes around 2 sides as well. We were shown a different unit with the 'same' floor plan and were told that the one we would get was going to be the same floor plan in a different location in the building.\u000a\u000aNow, what would a rational person deduce from this? Its reasonable to expect a slightly different view from the apartment. But one would expect the same floor plan. Which means windows on 2 sides of the living room and a patio which covers both sides, yes?\u000a\u000aNot in the case of Amli. For Amli, floor plan does not include the arrangement of windows or the arrangement of the patio. After applying for the apartment, we happened to see the Google street view of the apartment and realized that there could not possible be 2 perpendicular windows and the kind of patio we saw in the tour. When we asked about this, the leasing agent told us that the one we would get would have a smaller patio and by omission, admitted to the lack of a 2nd window. \u000a\u000aOn their website and in the quote given to us, both units have the exact same layout 2-d photo. \u000a\u000aSo far, there has been no response to our request for refund of the $700 charge placed on our credit card for the application we made.

VI have lived here at AMLI on 2nd for three months.  I had to give a 60 day notice to break the lease because of a job change.  AMLI requires that you pay two months rent plus a 1 month's rent penalty.  I told management that I wanted to release if possible to save money.  There was a potential tenant that wanted to rent my place, but rather than inform me, they lied to the tenant stating I was not going to move out until the end of the 60 days.   This way, they make more money.  The tenant spoke to me directly later and we both put pressure on management to relet.  The relet fee is almost the same as the monthly rent and I still have to pay the rent for the 60 days.  I will never stay at an AMLI apartment again.  They are indeed a rip off.

VI swear this place is a hidden gem. Employees and food always consistent. Be sure to look up the times they are open and closed, I have forgotten before and showed up and it was closed. Love the bread there that they have with the sandwiches, Meatballs on point and lasagna as well! Yummy!

VThis is the best pizza I have ever tasted, hands down. Beautiful, incredibly fresh toppings, with a delicious sauce. Their gluten free crust was delightful. Incredibly friendly service, even to our party, which consisted of three adults and six children. My new favorite in Austin!

VWe absolutely love the food here, and the first time we came we had no problems at all. \u000aHOWEVER, we just went back for a quick lunch right as they opened...\u000a\u000aWe were the very first customers and there was NO ONE ELSE in the entire establishment. My GF and I prefer to sit next to one another, and chose a table (they told us we could choose), and apparently it was not the right choice. \u000a\u000aOur service suffered the ENTIRE time we were there because we chose to sit at a larger table instead of the smaller ones. Our server was OBVIOUSLY not pleased with us. We will go back, simply because of the food, but I wouldn't recommend it for the service. It's fallen much lower on our favorites list because of it.

VYou gotta climb a few steps, but if you end up with a spot on the floor in front of the stage, you're in luck- the standing area is relatively small. It's a dark hall, but an awesome venue for music!

VMy husband bought a beautiful ring for me for my birthday. The owner was in the store at the time and we had a wonderful time visiting with her and learning about her company. She is very humble about her life accomplishments and her designs. She sized the ring for me and shipped it to my home. I plan to shop there when I am in Austin again.

VBought a wonderful set of cufflinks with my initials. The travel-inspired pieces give meaning to jewelry even a guy can get behind. Made shopping really easy, which is a huge plus. Any guy looking to buy his woman a gift should just go there.

VAs a guy shopping for a present, I find most jewelry stores boring.  Same old stuff everywhere. Sikara, on the other hand, feels like you walked into an international art exhibit.  Throughout the store, you'll find unique pieces from around the world.  Every time I give someone a gift from Sikara, they remember it since they always get compliments on the item.  I'm guessing that's because it stands out a lot more than stuff you find at other places.

VWe absolutely love the food here, and the first time we came we had no problems at all. \u000aHOWEVER, we just went back for a quick lunch right as they opened...\u000a\u000aWe were the very first customers and there was NO ONE ELSE in the entire establishment. My GF and I prefer to sit next to one another, and chose a table (they told us we could choose), and apparently it was not the right choice. \u000a\u000aOur service suffered the ENTIRE time we were there because we chose to sit at a larger table instead of the smaller ones. Our server was OBVIOUSLY not pleased with us. We will go back, simply because of the food, but I wouldn't recommend it for the service. It's fallen much lower on our favorites list because of it.

VI swear this place is a hidden gem. Employees and food always consistent. Be sure to look up the times they are open and closed, I have forgotten before and showed up and it was closed. Love the bread there that they have with the sandwiches, Meatballs on point and lasagna as well! Yummy!

VWe absolutely love the food here, and the first time we came we had no problems at all. \u000aHOWEVER, we just went back for a quick lunch right as they opened...\u000a\u000aWe were the very first customers and there was NO ONE ELSE in the entire establishment. My GF and I prefer to sit next to one another, and chose a table (they told us we could choose), and apparently it was not the right choice. \u000a\u000aOur service suffered the ENTIRE time we were there because we chose to sit at a larger table instead of the smaller ones. Our server was OBVIOUSLY not pleased with us. We will go back, simply because of the food, but I wouldn't recommend it for the service. It's fallen much lower on our favorites list because of it.

VWonderful visit every time I visit Austin. I have been to Austin for vacations and I always book a spa day for myself. I most recently visited the Hill Country location and had a wonderful massage and mani/pedi. I have also had a wonderful haircut @ the 2nd Street district location. When I arrived home, I got a thank you card in the mail from my manicurist and thought it was the sweetest thing :) Can't wait to go back.

VAustin Energy driver Christopher Martinez- 07-2010 with no license hits me from behind at a yield sign push me out into traffic.  Austin Energy then pulls up my tickets and claims I was warrant eligible and lied and said, I allegedly fled the scene.   I didn't flee the scene no warrants was for my arrest.  They lie to not pay for any damages.. The lady in claims division Belinda was unprofessional, rude was laughing at the matter.  0 stars for me.  That why they have 1.7  BEWARE OF THEIR DRIVERS..  How the heck you have no license driving a. commercial vehicle.  I will make sure I stay out of the area they  service.

VI got a disconnect fee 7 days ago and I paid the charge requested two days ago which still got my electricity turned off today I literally had to argue for over an hour to admit that they messed up\u000a\u000aI can see I'm not the only one they have done this too and this is not the only time they have done this to me\u000a\u000aI told them that I have a 10 month old daughter and she cannot withstand the Heat and see me in a sense they said that yes and wrongly turn the power off they should have it immediately back on so I told him I would wait one hour and then we are going to the main office with a camera on so if you see this I will edit it later and include the YouTube link of the video I will take video with all paperwork and include all phone conversation on it\u000a\u000aAnd then you can hear for yourself the lies that have caught them in for example last time they told me they had no way to contact people in the field and then when I said I'm not getting off the phone I went to speak to his supervisor my power was magically turned back on last time\u000a\u000aBut don't take my word for it just look at all the reviews LOL

Vi would give this 0 stars and i wish i could write 10,000 bad reviews for austin energy...not only did they withrdraw $270 (start up and deposit fees) TWICE, leaving me about $300 in the hole with my bank due to overdraft fees, but they continue to charge me late fees for bills i have already paid, in addition to many other unexplainable fees. This is horrible, but whats even worse is that nobody you talk to can provide a solution. This is especially true if you are a student, they have such a bad attitude and take advantage of you because apparently you "dont know how things work" and question why you would possibly want a refund of YOUR money when they overcharge you because they expect you to have no other bills to pay...apparently i feed off of air or something and dont need groceries?? (not that they even need a good reason to give me a refund...its my money after all i dont owe them any explanation). Now, online bill pay is for some reason suddenly suspended for my account (without notice) and i have to make a walk-in cash payment. (why?) Then, youre given a link to the locations to pay at, but the website link is outdated and just gives an error message. Austin energy does nothing but steal from you and then act like the victim, offering NO solutions to your problems or repayment. Still have not gotten the $270 refund they owe me from OCTOBER which they initially said would take a month (an entire month??? really..) Not a single good thing to say about Austin energy, I truly hope it rots.

VI believe they know what they are knowledgable and can help most problems. My computer had some serious issues that were mostly resolved. My main complaint is not everyone that may work on your computer is the most personable and clear on timing of repairs. There are a few staff you need to gravitate to when you stop in for assistance.

VFirst of all when you answer the phone don't just say hello!? Like you're shocked someone is calling your business. These jokers not only treated my wife with disrespect but also nearly ran her over by what I assume is the owner of this clown shop. (Larger old guy) Anyways if you want to be treated like a moron and then get the run around this is the place for you. When my wife asked for our computer back they told her that they'd already processed it and that there would be a fee to get it back (she never left the store and it was right in front of her) Also they said they already ordered parts (false) to run diagnostics. Upon my arrival to get back my property they simply just gave it back. No flac, beacause I'm a male? This is 2016 jubronies. I was able to get my laptop back without any verification of who I was What so ever.  If you have computer issues I'd suggest somewhere a little more buttoned up.

VI have been using Macworks for 6+ years. They have always been accommodating, helpful, and polite. They have repaired computers, and also rented computers to our small business. When they have gotten something wrong, they have corrected the problem or made up for it in some other way. I will continue to use them because they strive to make every customer experience a great one. They are local, and we should everything we can to support them.

VTo sum up, they seem very disorganized and distracted and slow.  \u000aI went into this place after finding out that there was a replacement battery program for my phone which was having problems. My main hope was that I would be able to have my phone fixed quickly and not have to make an appointment for the Apple Store.  I came in around 12-1 on a Wednesday. I spoke with several of their employees. The guy who fixes these problem was due later that day but not in at that time. I gave them my contact info and serial number of my phone so they could do the background work to minimize the time I had to be without my phone. 4pm the next day come around and no call back. I called them back and the guy was not in again. They took my info again and ended the call.  I get a call at 6pm from Jose and he seems distracted and also seems not to have any previous info that I had given them. He tells me that there are no appointment openings before Monday and that I would have to leave my phone for 2-3 hours for a diagnostics to see if my phone qualified for the battery replacement program. I had already verified that my phone was eligible on Apple's site and it had taken all of 2-3 minutes.  So I choose not to continue with their service because the Apple store could get me in sooner. Maybe getting another guy that works at just one location would stop problems like this in the future.The reason there are 2 stars is because the people in the store were nice and tried to be helpful.

VJP I'd a great coffee shop. Super friendly staff and great atmosphere.  I particularly like this coffee shop because in the morning they have delicious tacos from a local food truck, and they make their own tasty smoothies.   Internet is decent and usually a good crowd for people watching.

VThis place was terrible. 0 stars. Weak coffee, wifi didn't work and staff wasn't helpful in resolving the issue. The young chaps seamed more interested in socializing and than working. Also had the audacity of attempting to flirt in my distress. Not ok. Unprofessional. Never coming back.

VI don't know about downstairs, but we had about 80 people upstairs. Rooms were overpacked and sweltering. One waiter for all of us. Rooms upstairs are the size of bathrooms. You can have fun anywhere if the people you're with are great, but the Highball did nothing to help.

VKaraoke is mostly upstairs and the room was a little chilly. What I found weird was that the users can't control the volume and a non-server has to come up to adjust it. Food isn't bad, but they don't have lots of finger-food and snacks. I was surprised that they didn't have an elevator for the 2nd floor. They would either have to use their existing space or buy up the 2 condos near the corner of their space to use for the elevator (and storage/office)... it's funny that Alamo didn't include one.

VA beautiful little place in a great part of town. Excellent food and service. I had the halibut. It was the best I've ever tasted. It was surprisingly moist, and the ratatouille it was served with was the perfect complement.

VSeafood focused interesting plates. We came here for happy hour and ended up having dinner too. Tried a lot of their plates and cocktails. Other than one or two plates, I really enjoyed the dishes. They play jazz and its a cozy atmosphere. Would recommend for date night.

VSide note: most of these reviews are for the previous restaurant. Coast is a great new addition to the neighborhood! Small place but definitely worth trying. Good idea to get reservations, I think we were just squeezed in. Place just smells super fresh and the food tastes the same! Got the grouper tacos and grouper sandwich special. Excited to come back and try more!

VWe've been here twice since it recently opened and both times were fantastic. While I normally prefer raw oysters, the baked oysters were out of this world. The fish tacos were the best I've every had and burger was excellent. We also tried the scallops and pork belly the first time we went - also excellent. All of the dishes are innovative and very well prepared. I wouldn't mind seeing the wine list expanded a bit, but all of the selections on the list are very good. We'll be back soon!

VI was very surprised with this venue -- in a good way!  I liked how it was open to the outside so you could mingle on the patio furniture while waiting for the music to start. It's intimate without being confining and has great acoustics from anywhere you stand. The bar prices are a little steep, but that is to be expected at any music venue (and for a craft beer junkie).

VExperience was great except for some of the staff was pretty rude. I was looking for water fountains and was accidentally walking towards what I guess was backstage? Staff told me to turn around if I was looking for bathrooms and I politely said I was sorry and I was looking for water. She rudely directed me around the corner, which was indeed where I was walking towards anyways. I mean damn lady I bet it feels good to have authority but I was just thirsty. About 10 minutes later, my sister and I were running to catch a show. One of the staff asked  us to stop running and before we were even given two seconds to let that register/let us slow down, another staff member said "No running means NO RUNNING" like we're in kindergarten or something. \u000a\u000aIf it wasn't for the relative politeness of the bartender and the checkpoint security personnel who made up for the rest of the staff, as well as having an otherwise great experience, my rating would be two stars instead of three.

VLOVED IT, when we went to see PETER FRAMPTON, last night went to see TESLA, after 5 security checks, while watching the concert, was racially profiled inside, by some rude asshole , who even refused to give a name or title. Gives you ill feeling, we both got sick to our stomach, and the entire staff I would have to say politely is RUDE. Each other piggy back off one another. We are so deeply disappointed, we are never going back, Staff is plain rude, even after complaining, the Staff did Nothing and we ended up leaving in 1st 30 minutes as TESLA started to Play... I have zero tolerance for racial profiling and Thankfully, this was in our control whether to stay or leave, we decided to LEAVE..............Thank you Moody Theater & Staff for ruining OUR evening..............

VNot sure why there are a bunch of negative reviews for a credit union appearing on the 'Silicon Laboratories' page.\u000a\u000aSiLabs is a semiconductor company, not a credit union.  These reviews are inaccurate -- and are probably intended for an 'A+ Credit Union' that is no longer located at 200 W Cesar Chavez

VGym is usually fairly clean. Has a lot of good equipment. The trainers are con artists though. I bought a training package for 24 sessions and the trainers would lie about when I came in for visits and training sessions. They would charge me for sessions I never attended, even though, I gave them ample notice of my scheduling changes. Then, I went to the management about the overbilling and management said that they would sort out the errors but management never called back. They're lying scum. Buyer beware.

VThe trainers are great (I work with Steven and Lyndsey, and everyone else seems super friendly and knowledgeable), and the facility is well-maintained.  Parking is easy, which is important downtown.  The only thing I can ding them on is the showers - they're clean, but there's basically zero water pressure.

VSo the facility is great- what I don't like is the business. Recruiters came out trying to sell trial runs for their gym and memberships. Three people approached me and eventually a girl convinced me to try it out (it was a special). I signed up under the guise that I could leave. My second time at the gym a machine not set properly ended up with my throwing my shoulder out- not one staffer came to respond to me screaming. The third time I came in, looked for help but "everyone was too busy" so I told the front desk I was done. Fast forward to a bill appearing for $100 dollars from the gym. When I called to express my grievances I was told by the manager "Steve Johnson" that they don't want my membership anyway and would be happy to see me gone (super professional!). He also claimed that he signed me up and remembered "everything I agreed to and that I was mistaken" and repeated "I'm not the kind of member they want". Is that because I'm gay? Is that because I questioned my bill? Is that because they don't like people questioning why they don't give out paperwork of any kind when doing recruitment drives (at least not where I was)? They took my credit card said they didn't need anything else handed me a tag and proceeded to harass other people at my work.... If they weren't so belittling on the phone, paid attention to me speaking and didn't interrupt telling me "I'm confused" I probably wouldn't be writing this. BUT COME ON

VLast year I got completely outfitted for the 2016/17' ski season at St. Bernard Sports. This store is epic! If you are looking for the absolute best quality ski equipment, clothing and accessories, you would be making a huge mistake not to go directly to St. Bernard Sports. Chris S., patiently assisted me and fitted my boots, made expert recommendations about what jacket to get (Kjus) which I am grateful to have purchased. This year I was bone dry and completely warm thanks to Chris's recommendation of the Kjus jacket. Their prices are exactly comparable to other sellers, if you think they are expensive, they are not. They just sell the absolutely best quality of merchandise which costs more than discount brands because it is better. The store itself is really nice and comfortable to shop in not to mention the complementary draft beer and espresso if you so choose. Don't make a mistake, get the best and go to St. Bernard Sports, they have done all the homework for you on the best brands already. Now I am going back for some new golf clothing. Ask for Chris S, he is the best!

VI returned a jacket and order another that was showing in the system. I was told my jacket should arrive in 5 business days. So after waiting 7 business days, I decided to call Saint Bernard in the Domain to check on my order. When I called the employee informed me that my order was never filled and I will need to be refunded. Mind you, I did not receive notification of any sort about the order not being filled. If I hadn't called my money would still be sitting in the system and I would have never received the order that I place in person at the store. This by far is TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! That was my last time shopping there.

VI'm posting this review after a great experience working with Eddie while fitting new snow ski boots. He was incredibly knowledgable, helpful and patient during the two separate trips I made to the store--first to source a pair of boots based on my particular anatomy and then on a return trip to fit a pair of boots that I ended up buying elsewhere. The latter fact that I didn't purchase these from the store and still received fantastic service working with Eddie is a testament to his ultimate goal of making sure I ended up in a pair of boots that fit well and would make for great days on the snow. Never at any point did he try to unnecessarily up-sell any products or services. Quality guy and quality experience all the way. Cheers.
